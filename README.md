# WebDevPool

## What is this Project ?

We have built an application where Tech persons(here we are targeting the developers community) can Create their profile, Update their experience and education and much more. 
This web application will be a platform for Developers where developers can share their details like experience, company they work for and even showcase their work by connecting their github repositories to their profile. People visiting the website can post comments and like the other people post and can have a discussion on a post/topic. There will be a single user associated to every profile on the basis of their email. This webapp is little similar to linkedin but relates to developers' community.
The user can share thoughts using create a post and other users can also like and comment on otherâ€™s posts.
We have created this application for the recruitment purpose also, so that recruiters can visit our application and can visit as many profiles and can select/contact the perfect fit employee for their company.

### Routes User: 
This is a public route to perform user registration for the first time all the fields except avatar are required so backend validation are performed by using express-validator. Salting and hashing of the password is done by using bycrypt. Accessing the email photo is done using gravatar. Jwt sign in to pass the payload using jsonwebtoken. This is a post route.
